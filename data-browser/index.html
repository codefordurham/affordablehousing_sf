    <h1 class="top">Welcome to the data browser</h1>
    <p>Here you can browse through a curated list of data that helps illuminate what the City is doing around housing as well as give context on housing and population from other sources like the Census.</p>
    <p>The browser is broken up into two main areas: Housing Overview and Policies and Programs. Each chart or map gives a window into a specific topic to  help you understand what does housing look like now and how the City is addressing affordability via policies and programs.</p>
